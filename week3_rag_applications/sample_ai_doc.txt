Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence by machines.
AI systems can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as
visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.

Types of AI:
1. Narrow AI: Designed for specific tasks (e.g., image recognition)
2. General AI: Theoretical AI with human-like intelligence
3. Super AI: Hypothetical AI that surpasses human intelligence

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data.
Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning using neural networks.
